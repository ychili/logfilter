LogFilter

Print lines from log files which match the given date range and severity
level.

Use GNU date to convert dates into datestamps, then use AWK to filter
lines by field -- an overgrown version of this one-liner:

    awk \
      -v after=$(date --date=today-3days +%Y-%m-%d) \
      -v before=$(date --date=today+1day +%Y-%m-%d) \
      -v level='EMERG|ALERT|CRITICAL|ERROR|WARNING|NOTICE' \
      '$1 > after && $1 <= before && $3 ~ level' \
      ${logfiles}

The goal is to produce a digestible screenful of the most recent and
most urgent log messages.

Run-time requirements: Python 3.9+, GNU date, AWK
