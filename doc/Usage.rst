Configuration
-------------

Create a config file to customize the default values of the script
variables. These values can be overridden by command-line arguments. The
config file should be a series of variableâ€“value pairs, separated by an
equals sign ('='), each on their own line. Whitespace is ignored, and
lines starting with '#' will be ignored as comments.

The XDG configuration directory search path will be searched for config
files named 'logfilter/config'. The search path is based on the values
of environment variables XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
XDG_CONFIG_HOME will be searched first (if unset then this is equal to
'~/.config'), then XDG_CONFIG_DIRS (if unset then this is equal to
'/etc/xdg'). Values in earlier files take precedence over values in
later files. Most regular users should just put their config file at
'~/.config/logfilter/config'.

after : date
